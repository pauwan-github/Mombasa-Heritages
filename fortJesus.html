<body style="background-color:yellow;">
<p>It was built between 1593 and 1596 by the Portuguese. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site<br>
and one of Mombasa's top tourist attractions. Italian architect Cairati designed the structure, which is one of<br>
the world's finest examples of 16th century Portuguese millitary architecture.</p>
<p1>Built in the shape of a man, the fort was given the name of Jesus as a clear religious reference.<br>
The fort changed hands nine times between 1631 and 1875 before finally resting with the British.<p1>
<p>Although partially ruined, Fort Jesus houses a museum built over the former barracks for<br>the garrison.
Exhibits inlude a vast collection of ceramics and pottery reflecting<br> the various cultures that traded along the
coast.</P>
