<p>On the South East side of Mombasa Island, the Old Town is reminiscent of the days when<br> the Portuguese ruled
this important port.The town's inhabitants are mostly of Arab, Asian and European origin<br>and the architecture 
reflects their cultures.<p>
<p1>Ornately carved doors and balconies adorn the old buildings that jostle cheek to jowl along the narrow streets.<br>
History buffs can easily spend a couple of hours here, strolling along the atmospheric alleys and shipping<br>
for antiques, fragrant oils, spices and souvenirs. If you're looking for places to eat in Mombasa, you'll find plenty<br>
of restaurants and cafes in this area.</p1>
