began in 1971, when Dr. Rene Haller transformed the abandoned limestone quarries here into a thriving nature reserve.</p>

where each animal has a function within the flourishing ecosystem. Wildlife found here inludes giraffes, Cape buffalo,<br>
zebras, waterbucks and hippos. A highlight is the giraffe feeding, but be sure to check the times before visiting.<p1>
<p>The park was also home to famous interspecies couple that became an internet sensation after the 130-year-old<br>
tortoise, Mzee, adopted Owen, an opphaned hippo.</P>
<p1>Birds are also abundant in the park. more tha 160 species have been introduced to the area including weaver birds,<br>
cranes, pelicans and storks.<p1>
