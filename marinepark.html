<h1><font color="black">Mombasa Marine National Park</font></h1>
<h2>
<body style="background-color:yellow;">
<p>One of the busiest of Kenya's offshore reserves, Mombasa Marine National Park protects mangroves, seagrass beds<br>
sandy beaches and coral reef. Diving and snorkeling are popular things to do- especially North of Mombasa, from Mtwapa
Creek South to the entrance of Likoni.</p>
<p1>Seahorses, stingrays and eels are among the marine creatures inhabiting the reserve and the MV Dania is a popular<br>
wreck dive here. If you prefer to stay dry, you can view the diverse marine life from a gall-bottom boat.</p1>
<p>The popular beaches of Nyali, Bamburi and Shanzu all provide access to the marine park.</p>
