<p>Kilifi is a small beach resort on the banks of Kilifi Creek where yachts bob about in the breeze. One of the top<br>
tourist attractions here is the Mnarani Ruins, an ancient Swahili coastal settlement dating back to the 14th century.<br>
A huge baobab tree among the ruins is rumored to be the largest on the Kenyan coast.</p>
<p1>Kilifi is also home to top[notch golf club. At one time, Kilifi could only be reached by ferry, but in recent <br>
years a bridge was constructed to make it more accessible.</p1>
